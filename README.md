### CareGPT – AI-Powered Prescription & Healthcare Assistant

CareGPT is an advanced AI-driven healthcare assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and OCR to help users understand medical prescriptions and medicines in a clear and user-friendly manner.

The system is designed to read prescriptions, extract medicine information, and explain their use-cases using modern AI technologies.

# Created by: Purnika Malhotra

## Key Features

1. OCR-based prescription reading (handwritten or printed)

2. Automatic medicine name extraction

3. LLM-powered explanation of medicine use-cases

4. RAG-based knowledge retrieval for accurate responses

5. Conversational medical assistant using natural language

6. Web-based interface built with Streamlit

7. Cloud-ready architecture using AWS

## Core Technologies Used

# Large Language Models (LLMs)
Used to understand extracted prescription text and generate meaningful, human-readable explanations.

# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Ensures responses are grounded in verified medical knowledge rather than pure generation.

# LangChain
Used to orchestrate prompts, retrieval pipelines, and interaction with LLMs.

# OpenAI API
Powers the language understanding and generation capabilities.

# OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
Extracts text from prescription images.

# AWS
Used for cloud services such as storage, scalability, and deployment support.

## How CareGPT Works

1. The user uploads a prescription image.

2. OCR extracts raw text from the prescription.

3. Extracted text is processed to identify medicine names.

4. A RAG pipeline retrieves relevant medical information.

5. An LLM (via OpenAI + LangChain) generates:

a. Medicine purpose

b. General use-case

c. Easy-to-understand explanations

d. The results are displayed through an interactive web interface.

### Prescription Understanding & Medicine Use-Cases

# 1. CareGPT helps users:

a. Read difficult or unclear prescriptions

b. Identify prescribed medicines

c. Understand why a medicine is prescribed

d. Reduce dependency on manual interpretation

# 2. This is especially beneficial for:

a. Patients

b. Elderly individuals

c. Non-medical users

d. Healthcare education and awareness
